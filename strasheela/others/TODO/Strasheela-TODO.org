*** Install XRI on MBP 

**** TODO Contact developers on failed installation attempt		 :@MAIL:

    I tried to install XRI on MacOS 10.4, but the configure script failed. Below are the error messages (I filtered out all other messages). It appears the configure script somewhere hardwires the Mozart installation directory to /usr/lib/mozart and can therefore not find the Mozart installation on my system in /usr/local/oz. Setting OZHOME does not help.

*** Understand XRI 

**** TODO Read documentation and try examples

***** Understand whether/how I can define a relation between XRI variables and FD variables

      All I found was reflection (?) procedures like XRI.getUpperBound and XRI.getMidPoint, which return a corresponding float. I could then transform the float to a FD int. However, it appears XRI does not support any constraint which defines a direct relation (e.g., there is not constraint like {XRI.absRound XRI_var FD_var})


*** Generalise Strasheela distribution Strategy for possible XRI 

    XRI requires special distribution definitions. I somehow need to generalise the Strasheela distribution if parameter values should be either FD ints or XRI vars

    TODO: specify next actions


*** Define XRI temporal constraints

    Presently, the temporal constraints are only defined for FD int startTimes, durations etc.

    Possible generalisation: some flag (e.g., set in Init) specifies whether _all_ temporal variables are FD ints (the default) or XRI variables. The suitable constraints are then applied accordingly.
 

*** Generalise accessors used for output

    Accessor methods like getDurationInSeconds or getPitchInMidi must be generalised to support either FD ints or XRI vars


** TODO Move ET31.score.chordsToScore to HS.score.chordsToScore

   Check where I use ET31.score.chordsToScore and update it accordingly
   Examples: ET31.out, testfiles..


** Introduce some generalised concept of 'cadence' 

   Example: {Cadence Chords Scale} constraints that union of all pitch classes in Chords (list of N chords) contains all pitchclasses of Scale. Additional arguments (some FD int?) may allow to specify whether cadence ends in I or some form of deceptive cadence occurs. 
   Combined with disallowing of weak harmonic steps with ProgressionStrength this should result in classical cadence (doublecheck ??)
 
   What generalised notions are there in the literature for a cadence?
   My problem: I would like to have a cadence concept which also works, e.g., for music in extended just intonation and is not simply something like II V I... I would like to structure [unconventional] music. Does this problem occur in literature? How do they do this in Jazz, for example?

*** TODO Check literature for cadence concepts

    Is there anything like a generalised concept proposed already

*** Define constraint 


** Introduce some generalised concept of resolution of dissonances

*** TODO Extend chord music representation: which chord degrees are dissonant?

    Which pitch classes are dissonant is expressed in database with chord degrees

    Constraint method isDissonantChordNote(PitchClass B): tests whether PitchClass (or scale degree?) is specified to be dissonant in chord database


*** TODO Define constraint {IsDissonanceR MyPitchClass B}

    Constraint needed to define rules of resolving dissonances: 

    NOT(isChordNote(MyPitchClass)) OR isDissonantChordNote(MyPitchClass)

    Where? In HS.rules?


*** Rule ideas for resolving dissonances

    Direct resolution: 

    Strict case: next melodic note has pitch class one
    semitone/wholetone below dissonant pitch class, which is consonant
    
    
    Less strict case: next melodic note has consonant pitch class which
    is at maximum a wholetone above or below the dissonant pitch class
    (also pitch repetition is permitted)

    Indirect resolution: 



** Introduce some abstraction for modulation
   
   NOTE: unfinished action list -- project postponed

*** Define constraints defining relations between chords and scales which result in expressing modulation
    
    Modulation expressed with chord sequence and sim sequence of scales which overlap

    ?? Overlapping scales: chords should use only pitches occuring in both scales

    After overlapping ends, new scale is clarified by some (form of) cadence

    Re-read Schoenberg on this matter

*** Think about other ways

   Are there other ways: using overlapping scale objects effectively results in CSP which constraints hierarchic structure

   Old Goal (unrealistic): user can freely define tempo curve and time shift curve for any temporal container in score 
   
   New reduced goal: user can freely define a single global tempo curve (possibly defining segments locally) and nested time shift functions for any temporal container in score

** [#A] optimal solution for CSPs with soft constraints

   Design CSP template / abstractions with which I can model soft constraints by reified constraints and rate them in importance. A best-solution-search will find an optimal solution 

*** TODO Brainstorm: how can I collect goodness-measurement for all soft constraints and combine them


** Update Lilypond output 

   Lilypond export outputs only rather old version. Meanwhile, Lilypond handles nested scores (quasi sim/seq containers) better than old version, but behaviour of old version is pertained when using Lily's conversion script. So, I should update my Lily output to a more Lily syntax version

** Refactoring 

*** [#A] Concurrent procedure/method filter (filterThreaded) which does return stream instead of list

    as soon as enough information is available on specific score
    object to fulfull given test function, add it to stream. Close
    stream as soon as it is known that no further elements will be
    added.

**** TODO Synchronise Strasheela on MBP and Office Mac			:URGENT:

     SVN commit changes on Office Mac, so I can update the MBP accordingly

**** More Info

     NOTE: this matter could make it into a publication (part of a publication)! 

     Related approach: find using filter + reified constraints as boolean tests is related but note the same. 

     However, even if boolean test would return true for some datum already, find blocks if reified constraint blocks on some element before. This new approach works even when I don't know in which order variables are determined and thus in which order elements are added to the stream. 

     Similar issue with filter: even with reified constraints as boolean tests, filter may block completely until enough information is available in all data. An concurrent filter would return data in a stream as soon as enough information is available on these data.
  
     Sufficient to have a filter which concurrently processes a list of objects. I only need to collect all data with collect (e.g., all data matching test function) and then do concurrent filter on this result list. 

     A method filterThreaded would further improve the application of delayed constraints where filtering tests used reified constraints 
     E.g., I could use a method filterThreaded for a better definition of getSimultaneousItems

# <<ScoreOutsideScript>> 
*** [#A] Does score outside script/space save memory. If so, define abstractions/templates for having the score outside the script

    First carefully evaluated what I can gain from recomputation and adaptive recomputation. Only if I feel it is necessary, I will then further improve memory (also a bit runtime) efficiency by having (most data of) the music representation stored in the top-level space only

See ../../testing/zy_Efficiency/KeepMusicRepresentationOutsideComputationalSpace.oz 

**** Measure how the different approaches differ in the amout of memory (and time) comsumed by copying.

 Approaches:

  - !! Measure total amount of memory and time required by search (e.g. put each script in an application of its own, call plain solver and measure time and memory with UNIX tools such as time and ...)
    -> which UNIX tool measures memory consumption of a call?

  - !!?? Measure with Oz profiler:
    problem: the memory/time comsumption of copying seems not to show if I just compile CSP with profiling information.
    Alternative option: temporarily, compile whole Mozart with profiling and check memory consumption of space copying proc (results will be very hard to read in this case!) 


**** _if_ I found out that memory reduction can be significantly reduced by defining the music representation outside the script/space, then I have to develop abstractions/templates for the following cases (it will be more complex than having the score inside the script, but it shouldn't be too hard..).


  - distribution strategies
  - implicit constraints
  - expressive rule applications 


**** split Strasheela in two parts: the part to define CSPs and the part to solve them. The solver part uses a very [speichersparende] representation based on records instead of classes and objects (i.e. I need to define/port the data abstraction interface required for distribution strategies). 

     -> I did some profiling to better understand this issue (see Strasheela/texting/profiling.oz)
     
       - Memory requirement of Strasheela mainly caused by elaborated data structure: there is so much explicitly represented. A more efficient data representation for the search would dump all information not required by the CSP: this is a very difficult task!!

         -> BTW: the memory difference between a record-based and an OOP based data structure appears to be neclegtable


***** The Solver 'the server'
     
      - The solver expects a CSP spec which specifies the music representation (with a unique ID for each variable) and a list of constraints which specify which variables are constrained by which constraint (aux variables also supported by the constraint spec).
      Also distribution strategy defined by spec.

      - This solver then creates the search script from the CSP spec 
     
      - This solver is much more efficient than current Strasheela: much less copying because much smaller data structure

      - The solver would be even more efficient if it could apply batch recomputation: wait for Geoz..
  
***** The second part of Strasheela (the 'client') defines the CSP specs: the present Strasheela could be modified to do this. It is even possible, that the present Strasheela could be modified such that it either does the search directly itself or alternatively creates this CSP spec (this option could be useful for prototyping and also helps to keep the present application a running program ..).

     - The CSP def part of Strasheela could/would mirror _every_ propagator defined by Oz. All constraints in a Strasheela program would be replaced my its Strasheela substitute. With a global switch (init variable/cell?) the user could decide whether the Strasheela constraint substitutes either just apply the orig Oz constraint or otherwise 'record' this constraint call for the CSP spec by denoting the name of the constraint and the unique IDs of all its argument vars 

       !! -> How to access the ID when the constraint gets the variable directly?? I would need to rewrite all Strasheela programs such that every Strasheela constraint substitute always expects parameter objects instead of variables!

***** Instead with this Strasheela 'client', other CAC applications could also create CSP specs and call the Strasheela 'server' (e.g. PWGL)

    Actually I think (from experience with Java unit tests in
    industry) that there should be something better than wait in real
    time for a timeout when testing concurrent programs.  The timeouts
    slow down the tests a lot, and the outcome is nondeterministic
    (e.g. tests run fine for the developer, but fail in a complete
    system build).
    
    I'd like a meta-interpreter which can provoke all the nasty races
    deterministically and test that they are handled correctly, and
    run as quickly as possibly by simulating the passage of time.  But
    that would be a very big project.
