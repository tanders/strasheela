* Strasheela examples						    :STRASHEELA:

** TODO Go through test files and collect examples there in files in examples folder 

   In particular, collect example files in contribution examples subfolders centrally in srasheela/examples (possibly in subfolders there)

** TODO Create decatonic test chord progression				  :NEXT:

   Check chord progression CSPs I did for 31 ET and adapt them for
   22 ET with decatonic scales
   
*** Further ideas for rules 

    - Only decatonic chords
    - Strong chord progressions (Schoenberg rule)
    - ?? Finish with cadence (needs def what cadence is)
    - ?? Constrain chord identity with morphology constraints to roughly follow "orgiastic curve"

    - ?? resolve dissonances
    - ?? control degree of dissonances (e.g., either only gradually increasing and decreasing of dissonance or use of dissonance where [betonung] is needed)
    - ?? 'harmonic motifs': short chord sequences which are repetitions of previous sequences but on different degree (possibly even extending tonality..)


** 'Interesting arpeggio' example [[file:~/oz/music/Strasheela/private/examples/forOlleRomo/Arpeggio.oz][Arpeggio.oz]]				  :SOON:

   [?? Wait until I have prototype-based motif model -- he wants to
   shape duration and velo parameters with functions, I can do that
   with fenvs, but is this consistent with new motifs idea?]

  ?? Duration working time: 1d -- probably more :)

*** TODO Describe task in English, mentioning Strasheela techniques to use
*** Implement description


** Create small-scale musical example which demonstrates the effect of LUtils.cFilter and LUtils.cFind :NEXT:
   
*** TODO Sketch a small-scale music theory in plain English  

    Idea: modulation example: scale(s) related to each chord (and chords related to each note) are found with LUtils.cFilter/LUtils.cFind. 

    Alternative idea:  
    
    map(filter(getAllNotes(myScore), isOnStrongBeat), 
      f : f(n) := getPitchClass(n) \in getPitchClassSet(find(getChordProgression(myScore), 
							     g : g(c) := isSimultaneous(n, c))))

*** TODO Implement this theory

    see LUtils-test.oz for a LUtils.cFilter and LUtils.cFind test


*** More Info

    NOTE: this matter could make it into a publication (part of a publication)! 

    Related approach: find using filter + reified constraints as boolean tests is related but note the same. 

    However, even if boolean test would return true for some datum already, find blocks if reified constraint blocks on some element before. This new approach works even when I don't know in which order variables are determined and thus in which order elements are added to the stream. 

    Similar issue with filter: even with reified constraints as boolean tests, filter may block completely until enough information is available in all data. An concurrent filter would return data in a stream as soon as enough information is available on these data.
 
    Sufficient to have a filter which concurrently processes a list of objects. I only need to collect all data with collect (e.g., all data matching test function) and then do concurrent filter on this result list. 

    A method filterThreaded would further improve the application of delayed constraints where filtering tests used reified constraints 
    E.g., I could use a method filterThreaded for a better definition of getSimultaneousItems

*** Weighted constraints for Strasheela

**** TODO Revise my idea sketch on paper 

     see folder "Strasheela: weighted constraints"

***** Question: should I better use generic framework (e.g., semiring-based soft constraints) instead of only specific case weighted constraints

      Counterargument: I can implement weighted constraints with FD ints, and I can transform all existing Strasheela constraints in soft weighted constraints with reification. Also, this will still work with GeOz
      For all other frameworks I need at least real interval constraints (and who is maintaining them..)


**** TODO Write dummy CSP with weighted constraints 

**** With the dummy example create abstractions for writing weighted constraint problems 

     E.g., 
     - How to easily collect and sum all weights (store sum FD int in info slot of top-level container, so comparison constraint of best solution search can easily access it?). 
     - "Dynamic" soft constraints: what is my formalism? Idea: proc (constraint) returning cost as last arg. Can be applied easily with all mapping funs (e.g., MapNeighbours) and results are then added
     - Soft variant of PercentTrue: returns cost how far constraint is violated
       - Other soft variant of PercentTrue: allow for range spec (Min#Max)
	 Less precise, but more simple (and more efficient -- no optimisation..)


** Markov chain constraints which include probablilty			  :WAIT:

   Wait for soft constraints support for Strasheela

*** Recapitulate my simple Markov chain constraint

*** TODO Extend/Edit definition using PercentTrue (as soft constraint)

    - Markov chain def 
      - For each clause in Markov chain
	- For each sublist of given list (sublist length depending on
	  order, 0th order: sublist length is 1)
	  - Apply reified constraint checking checking whether clause holds
      - Check probability with soft PercentTrue, return cost/penalty FD int
    - Return cost sum of all clauses: will be used for optimising with BAB 

    The following values are vars: input list, clauses (value sequences and percentages).
    Fixed: number of clauses and order.  
    So, this approach can be used for generation and [engeschraenkt] for analysis.
    ?? How can I make number of clauses constrainable? 
    
    ?? Use name MarkovChain for new constraint and give old defs
    MarkovChain, MarkovChain_1 a new name

It appears the configure script somewhere hardwires the Mozart installation directory to /usr/lib/mozart and can therefore not find the Mozart installation on my system in /usr/local/oz.

*** Understand XRI 

**** TODO Read documentation and try examples

***** Understand whether/how I can define a relation between XRI variables and FD variables

      All I found was reflection (?) procedures like XRI.getUpperBound and XRI.getMidPoint, which return a corresponding float. I could then transform the float to a FD int. However, it appears XRI does not support any constraint which defines a direct relation (e.g., there is not constraint like {XRI.absRound XRI_var FD_var})


*** Generalise Strasheela distribution Strategy for possible XRI 

    XRI requires special distribution definitions. I somehow need to generalise the Strasheela distribution if parameter values should be either FD ints or XRI vars

    TODO: specify next actions


*** Define XRI temporal constraints

    Presently, the temporal constraints are only defined for FD int startTimes, durations etc.

    Possible generalisation: some flag (e.g., set in Init) specifies whether _all_ temporal variables are FD ints (the default) or XRI variables. The suitable constraints are then applied accordingly.
 

*** Generalise accessors used for output

    Accessor methods like getDurationInSeconds or getPitchInMidi must be generalised to support either FD ints or XRI vars


** Introduce some generalised concept of 'cadence'
 
   What generalised notions are there in the literature for a cadence?
   My problem: I would like to have a cadence concept which also works, e.g., for music in extended just intonation and is not simply something like II V I... I would like to structure [unconventional] music. Does this problem occur in literature? How do they do this in Jazz, for example?

   See GTD folder "cadence sets"

*** TODO Check literature for cadence concepts

    Is there anything like a generalised concept proposed already


**** Mazzola: cadencial set 

***** [info] What is a cadencial set?

     file:///Users/t/Desktop/mamufaq.html#Q_cadencialset

A cadencial set, or cadence-set, is Mazzola's terminology for a set of vertical sonorities that determine a key completely. E.G., the chords IV and V uniquely fix a certain major key, as well as the chords V7 and I - which may be one of the reasons that these became popular as parts of cadences.
Note that the property is based on sets, not on progressions - it is "purely vertical" and does not include the time component. Hence it is not sufficient for musical styles where beginning notes or chords are distinctive marks (such as the system of modes in medieval and renaissance music).
If a certain set is cadencial, then every set containing it is cadencial, too. So the really interesting things are minimal cadencial sets.
From this viewpoint, there is an interesting polarity between major and harmonic minor. From the 7 triads of the diatonic major scale we can build the following 5 minimal cadencial sets: {II, III}, {III, IV}, {IV, V}, {II, V} and {VII} - whereas in harmonic minor, every pair of triads forms a minimal cadence-set. Hence we have 21 unique minimal ways to fix a certain minor key - which is, BTW, the absolute maximum obtainable with 7 3-element sonorities.


**** Rothenberg "A Model for Pattern Perception with Musical Applications"
     
     Part II, p. 369: minimal set to identify C major among all major scales is G B F

     OK, that makes sense, but that only works as minimal set if (i) there are only major scales and (ii) the listener does know that there are only major scales and knows this scale well

     So, for my purposes it might be sufficient to require that all pitches are sounded in a cadence. 


*** TODO Define cadence constraint for [cadencial set] (only required pitches)

    The strict cadence constraint requires that *all* scale notes are contained in Chords. However, some theorists (Mazzola, Rothenberg) suggest that it may be sufficient to bring only those pitches which make it unmistakable which key we are in.


**** Idea (Strasheela code sketch)

     ContextScales is the set of all scales which form the context of our musical universe  
     MyScale is a particular scale from our musical universe 
     We are looking for the minimum subset of MyScale which is not contained in any of the other context scales. 


    Example: 
    ContextScales is the major scale in all its 12 ET transpositions
    MyScale is C major scale
    MinimumSet = {G, B, F}
    Note: this set is not sufficient if ContextScales contain, e.g., dorian scales as well, because G dorian also contains these pitches. 


     SufficientSet = {FS.var.decl}
     {FS.subset SufficientSet {MyScale getPitchClasses($)}}
     {ForAll {LUtils.remove ContextScales fun {$ X} X == MyScale end}
      proc {$ ContextScale} 
       	{FD.nega 
         {Combinator.'reify' 
	  proc {$} {FS.subset SufficientSet {ContextScale getPitchClasses($)}} end}
	 1}
      end}

    for MinimumSet minimise SufficientSet



*** TODO Define abstraction (constraint?) which checks whether a set of pitch classes is cadencial for a certain scale 

    The literature may discuss how this is done for the diatonic scales. But is there also a more general way which would would for, say, Erlich's decatonic scales?


*** ?? Define cadence model of mediaval / renaisssance music

    Not based on cadencial set. Instead, additional pitches are introduced to confirm root key with semitone step 



*** DONE Define strict constraint 
    CLOSED: [2008-04-24 Thu 18:26]

   Example: {Cadence Chords Scale} constraints that union of all pitch classes in Chords (list of N chords) contains all pitchclasses of Scale. Additional arguments (some FD int?) may allow to specify whether cadence ends in I or some form of deceptive cadence occurs. 
   Combined with disallowing of weak harmonic steps with ProgressionStrength this should result in classical cadence (doublecheck ??)



   
** Introduce some generalised concept of resolution of dissonances

*** Extend chord music representation: which chord notes are dissonant?

**** DONE Edit default database: which pitch classes are dissonant?
     CLOSED: [2008-03-17 Mon 12:52]
     
**** TODO Extend chord music representation (as mixin)

     Chord representation similar to representation of chord pitch
     classes: dissoance PCs in database, transposed by transposition
     param

**** TODO Extend note music representation (as mixin)

     Constraint method isDissonantChordNote(PitchClass B): tests
     whether PitchClass (or scale degree?) is specified to be
     dissonant in related chord


*** TODO Define constraint {IsDissonanceR MyPitchClass B}

    Constraint needed to define rules of resolving dissonances: 

    NOT(isChordNote(MyPitchClass)) OR isDissonantChordNote(MyPitchClass)

    Where? In HS.rules?

*** TODO Define abstraction similar to {DissonanceResolvedR MyNote ResolveConditions} 

    For ideas cf. meth nonChordPCConditions(Conditions)
    [[file:~/oz/music/Strasheela/strasheela/trunk/strasheela/contributions/anders/HarmonisedScore/source/Score.oz::meth%20nonChordPCConditions%20Conditions][file:~/oz/music/Strasheela/strasheela/trunk/strasheela/contributions/anders/HarmonisedScore/source/Score.oz::meth nonChordPCConditions Conditions]]


**** Rule ideas for resolving dissonances

     Direct resolution: 

     Strict case: next melodic note has pitch class one
     semitone/wholetone below dissonant pitch class, which is consonant
     
     
     Less strict case: next melodic note has consonant pitch class which
     is at maximum a wholetone above or below the dissonant pitch class
     (also pitch repetition is permitted)

     Indirect resolution: 



** Introduce some abstraction for modulation
   
   NOTE: unfinished action list -- project postponed

*** Define constraints defining relations between chords and scales which result in expressing modulation
    
    Modulation expressed with chord sequence and sim sequence of scales which overlap

    ?? Overlapping scales: chords should use only pitches occuring in both scales

    After overlapping ends, new scale is clarified by some (form of) cadence

    Re-read Schoenberg on this matter

*** Think about other ways

   Are there other ways: using overlapping scale objects effectively results in CSP which constraints hierarchic structure

   


** Harmonic constraint ProgressionStrength

*** Superstrong progressions reconsidered

    [wait until cadencial set constraint/proc is defined]

    Alternative definition: superstrong progressions are cadencial (the union of their pitch classes contains all pitches which define a key)
    -> According to this def, progressions like V->VI or even V->VIb (which certainly are superstong according to Schoenberg) are not superstrong anymore but don't fall into any category.
    I may consider creating an additional definition based on the notion of cadencial sets. 


**** Info
     
     file:///Users/t/Desktop/mamufaq.html#Q_superstrong
     What is special in the chord progression IV-V?
     
     From: Inotmark <inotmark@aol.comnospam>.
     It is strong for a number of reasons:
     1) it has no tones in common
     2) it has a tritone between root of IV and third of V
     3) it is sufficient to define a key without the tonic chord appearing.
       	Schönberg calling it superstrong may be due to 3 above.
       	
       	Connection to MaMuTh:
       	Property (3) means, in Mazzola's terminology, that the chord set {IV, V} is cadencial.

** TODO Define variant of Schoenberg using chord primes			  :WAIT:

   Chord progression constraints currently use concept root. Define a variant which uses chord primes/fundaments (1/1) instead as an alternative.  


** Create chord, scale and interval database for JI 

   Database defined with ratios Num#Denom

*** Info

    Exports getter functions which expect arg PitchesPerOctave. Returned databases are filtered such that pitch classes / intervals which would be the same for an ET depending on PitchesPerOctave are [zusammengefasst]. 

    Problem dabei: I might want to use an alternative non-ET tuning later where different pitch classes / intervals would be tempered out. Fixing this problem would require to rewrite HS such that it is not based on ET tunings. Instead, you better use a higher value for PitchesPerOctave so that all your ratios are assigned to unique pitch class integers. The tuning table could then indeed temper out some intervals by assigning multiple PCs the same pitch in cent.

    and possibly further measurements

*** TODO Collect chords from Scala chord database 

*** TODO ?? Collect scales from Scala  

    Hm, how can I do that? The Scala modi are scale dependend, and the Scala scales are way too much.

    I could search through the Scala .scl files for files which 
    - contain only up to a given max pitch number 
    - contain only ratios

    Still, I would find too many scales (e.g. well-temperaments specified with ratios).

    Can I somehow automate a search for 7-limit scales? Several scale files explicitly contain the term "7-limit" :)

*** Create little melodies						  :WAIT:

    Wait until databases and first test are created.

**** Melodic rules

     - ?? Restrict melodic intervals
     - Over given chord, all chord pitches are permitted and all non-chord pitches if they are resolved (step-wise progression)  
       Better form for this??
     - ?? Constrain pitch (class) sequence with morphology constraints (constrain contour of morphology analysis to roughly follow "orgiastic curve")
       

**** Melody using motifs (over chord progression)

     For now monophonic melody (with simple accompaniment?), later polyphonic setting, e.g., harmonic counterpoint

     Either use my motif model or (more simple?) sub-CSPs (extended
     scripts), e.g., with algo comp technique like L-ystems.

     Example rules for motifs:

     - restrict melodic contour (only tendency? with something like PercentTrue_Range)
     - restrict rhythm to something recognisable (i.e. motif instances are recognised)
       Again, do this 'soft'. E.g., specify startTime (relative to motif start) and duration of important notes, without specifying the position of this note (i.e. number of notes can vary). Or specify the start time (relative to motif start) of local pitch maxima (again, number of notes can vary).

     - ?? Use timing curve to create 'interpretation' (create variants for different motifs)

****** Transform ET scale into just scale

       harmonicity calculations require JI ratios, not an ET scale... 

       Note: this operation takes long time. 

	 Approximate [LIMIT]

       Hm, this completely changes the scale, probably a less good idea.
       Instead, for every interval (chord/scale), I could do the approximation myself (already in ET31 database..), and then use these data for my queries

****** Display interval info

       First, change attribute displayed with commands like SHOW. See possible values below

	 set attribute <VALUE>

       Then display values, e.g.,

	 Show
	 Show/Attribute : Only displays attribute

       Note: only works for JI ratios, not 31 ET


       Values (http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/scala/help.htm#SET): 
       - GRADUS: the Gradus Suavitatis of Euler 
       - HARMON: the Barlow harmonicity value

*** Add additional chords 

**** Play around with Scala clavier to find additional chords 

***** TODO Find further septimal chords


**** Check Scala chord database: which chords fit into 31 ET

     I feel I did this already..


**** Re-check written info on chords in articles in [meinen Unterlagen] 

     I feel this is mostly done already


*** Add scales suitable for chords which go beyond 5-limit (not simply diatonic scales)
    
    If I want to use melodic steps, then I likely must use non-harmonic notes. However, then I must introduce scales (so the non-harmonic notes are not arbitrary). These scales must match the chords. 

**** DONE Get info: how can I construct suitable scales for given set of chords :ARCHIVE:
     CLOSED: [2008-04-07 Mon 18:45]

    Possible approaches (see new menu in Scale): create Euler-Fokker genus (lattice), create Fokker periodicity block, create poly chordal scale, create combination product set ...  

    Use lattrice player for evaluating, testing, thinking about...



**** TODO Scale: After creating 31 ET scale check available scales (modes)

     Evaluate these scales for 7-limit harmony. Even if they are inverior to Erlich's decatonic scales, consider using them in a restricted way where scales change all the time togethere with the chords. 

     There are e.g. the following scales 

     - Octatonic
     - Lumma Decatonic
     - Hahn symmetric pentachordal
     - Hahn pentachordal

     Note that these scales are inverior to Erlich's decatonic scales

     - Melodically less convincing
     - Harmonically less flexible
       Less consonant intervals and chords are available 
       Example: 
       - In Erlich's scale there are 8 usable chords with same key pattern (2 not usable)
       - Lumma Decatonic: only 4 5th, 5 3rds (diatonically speaking)
       - Hahn summ pentachordal: 4 5th, 4 3th
       - Hahn pentachordal: 5 5th
       - Octatonic: 6 kl 3th


*** TODO Edit/Doublecheck the naming of chords, scales, and intervals

    Edit HS.db.getChordIndex and friends accordingly

*** Add additional diatonic scales 					 :MAYBE:



** Dissonance degree of absolute intervals

   The dissonance degree of intervals (and consequently chords constructed from these intervals) cannot be sufficiently described by pitch classes alone. Example maj third + octave is more consonant than third, 13:8 + octave is consonant but 13:8 is not. 7:5 is consonant, but 7:5 + octave is only weakly consonant (Doty, p. 24 + p. 51). 

   I should extend interval database such that I can include consonance measurements for different octave extensions of a specific interval. 

   I then need constraint {$ Pitch DissonanceDegree} which works on an absolute pitch (or pitch class + octave), and finds the correct "consonance/dissonance degree" depending on an absolute pitch

*** TODO Find out where I can get octave-dependend "consonance/dissonance degree""consonance/dissonance degree" (harmonicity distance, whatever) from Scala or else

** Define Monzo constraint for pitch class				 :MAYBE:

   Constraint which specifies relation between a pitch class (FD integer) and a vector (list of FD ints) of prime factor exponents (a "monzo")

   Definition internally depends on an n-dimensional lattice which maps positions in lattice (and that way prime exponents) to pitch classes. This lattice can be created with same fun which creates lattice for JI interval DB 

   for ideas cf. also [[file:~/oz/music/Strasheela/strasheela/trunk/strasheela/contributions/anders/HarmonisedScore/testing/Score-test.oz::HS%20score%20degreeToPC%20used%20to%20express%20monzos][file:~/oz/music/Strasheela/strasheela/trunk/strasheela/contributions/anders/HarmonisedScore/testing/Score-test.oz::HS score degreeToPC used to express monzos]]

** Chord pair constraint: Define voice leading distance 

   ?? {VoiceLeadingDistance Chord1 Chord2 ?X}

** Idea: user-guided search process: preserve already satisfying sections in output :WAIT:

   [wait until prototype-based motif model is realised]

   When composing, I have to listen to much solutions. Some parts of a solution might satisfy already, so I might want to keep that part and then get further results. How can I formalise this for easy use? 
   
*** Approach sketched

    CSP defined by extended script. One optional script arg expects function which creates a score. This score is 'unified' with solution. (if no arg was given, this unification is skipped) 

    Whenever we have a solution where we like some parts, we save (archive) the init record. In this textual representation we mark the bits we like (manual editing: add specific info tags to single elements or containers). For a more flexible approach, different marks might be introduced (use the mini language of the prototype-based motif model). For example, we might apply constraints directly to single score objects (e.g., this note should be highest pitch) 

    Some function (to define) expects this annotated score and creates reduced score spec whose score topology is exactly as the solution, constraints according to mini language are applied (typically, only marked parameters are determined, every other parameter is unconstrained).
   For convenience, this function might expect the path of the archive score file (*.ssco file) whose def in the included with an \include statement. 

   Parts which are marked in the input are again marked in the solution (so they have not to be marked again). 

   Later, this approach might be complemented by a GUI score interface (e.g., using PWConstraints score editor) for marking score parts to keep.

**** Mini language for marking score objects 

     See mini language for prototype-based motif model. It should be the same mini language.

**** Explanation why extra arg for extended script: 
     
     I need script definition where I can specify a partically determined solution. I already have that somehow. Script always returns solution and it usually contains some texual spec. However, I cannot use solution arg as input (its an object containing vars, I cannot have vars defined outside script), and within script the music representation is often created in stages. So, I need an additional arg which expects a function which returns partially determined score object. This score and the solution are then 'unified' (using my score unification via the textual representation. NOTE: things where these scores might differ including the info tag might be left out).  
   


define CSP which expects its solution score in textual form. 

archive init record. 

   

*** TODO Create simple example which uses this approach 

*** Create abstractions needed for this approach 

**** TODO Mini-language implementation

** Refactor Lilypond output of ET31 and ET22

   These functors share code doublications: reduce those and change (generalise/add) definitions to source/Output.oz if required. 
   
*** TODO Generalise Out.simToLilyChord 

    ET22 and ET31 don't use Out.simToLilyChord because this function is not general enough (instead they define it from scratch).

*** TODO Refactor ET31/ET22 MakeChordComment and MakeChordRatio and move into Output.oz

    Then use this def in ET22, ET31, and ~/.ozrc

*** TODO Refactor ET31 / ET22 ChordEt22ToLily and move into Output.oz

    Then use this def in ET22, ET31


** Small Refactoring: Chord/Scale/Note args like getChord / getScale

   the init args getChords, getScales etc for classes in HS.score are highly generic. However, this genericity is not always needed and if not needed then these args are cumbersome

*** TODO Implement alternative init arg which expects chord / scale directly

    Idea: in case I already know which chord/scale some object is related to I can hand this chord / scale directly over as init arg (using both init args chord and getChords must be permitted)

    First rethink whether I simply add such alternative args or wether there are better alternative ideas.. 

** Efficiency

# <<ScoreOutsideScript>> 
*** [#A] Does score outside script/space save memory. If so, define abstractions/templates for having the score outside the script

    First carefully evaluated what I can gain from recomputation and adaptive recomputation. Only if I feel it is necessary, I will then further improve memory (also a bit runtime) efficiency by having (most data of) the music representation stored in the top-level space only

See ../../testing/zy_Efficiency/KeepMusicRepresentationOutsideComputationalSpace.oz 

**** Measure how the different approaches differ in the amout of memory (and time) comsumed by copying.

 Approaches:

  - !! Measure total amount of memory and time required by search (e.g. put each script in an application of its own, call plain solver and measure time and memory with UNIX tools such as time and ...)
    -> which UNIX tool measures memory consumption of a call?

  - !!?? Measure with Oz profiler:
    problem: the memory/time comsumption of copying seems not to show if I just compile CSP with profiling information.
    Alternative option: temporarily, compile whole Mozart with profiling and check memory consumption of space copying proc (results will be very hard to read in this case!) 


**** _if_ I found out that memory reduction can be significantly reduced by defining the music representation outside the script/space, then I have to develop abstractions/templates for the following cases (it will be more complex than having the score inside the script, but it shouldn't be too hard..).


  - distribution strategies
  - implicit constraints
  - expressive rule applications 


**** split Strasheela in two parts: the part to define CSPs and the part to solve them. The solver part uses a very [speichersparende] representation based on records instead of classes and objects (i.e. I need to define/port the data abstraction interface required for distribution strategies). 

     -> I did some profiling to better understand this issue (see Strasheela/texting/profiling.oz)
     
       - Memory requirement of Strasheela mainly caused by elaborated data structure: there is so much explicitly represented. A more efficient data representation for the search would dump all information not required by the CSP: this is a very difficult task!!

         -> BTW: the memory difference between a record-based and an OOP based data structure appears to be neclegtable


***** The Solver 'the server'
     
      - The solver expects a CSP spec which specifies the music representation (with a unique ID for each variable) and a list of constraints which specify which variables are constrained by which constraint (aux variables also supported by the constraint spec).
      Also distribution strategy defined by spec.

      - This solver then creates the search script from the CSP spec 
     
      - This solver is much more efficient than current Strasheela: much less copying because much smaller data structure

      - The solver would be even more efficient if it could apply batch recomputation: wait for Geoz..
  
***** The second part of Strasheela (the 'client') defines the CSP specs: the present Strasheela could be modified to do this. It is even possible, that the present Strasheela could be modified such that it either does the search directly itself or alternatively creates this CSP spec (this option could be useful for prototyping and also helps to keep the present application a running program ..).

     - The CSP def part of Strasheela could/would mirror _every_ propagator defined by Oz. All constraints in a Strasheela program would be replaced my its Strasheela substitute. With a global switch (init variable/cell?) the user could decide whether the Strasheela constraint substitutes either just apply the orig Oz constraint or otherwise 'record' this constraint call for the CSP spec by denoting the name of the constraint and the unique IDs of all its argument vars 

       !! -> How to access the ID when the constraint gets the variable directly?? I would need to rewrite all Strasheela programs such that every Strasheela constraint substitute always expects parameter objects instead of variables!

***** Instead with this Strasheela 'client', other CAC applications could also create CSP specs and call the Strasheela 'server' (e.g. PWGL)



*** "Promise" value heuristic						 :MAYBE:
    
    Example: "promise" heuristic [ref Ginsberg or ref Geelen]
    value which is most likely to succeed: value which causes domains of other variables reduced least, more specifically the value for which the product of the remaining domain sizes is maximised
    
    no principle problem to do that in Oz: for each domain value of given var create a new space which copies current space. Within that space copy determine variable to space-specific domain value. Wait until space is stable. Then traverse all variables in CSP, collect their domain sizes and compute product. Return this product to value ordering algo which selects minimum
    Important: make sure that this computation is done only once per domain value. Also, best keep the space with the selected domain value, so that it must not be created again etc.

     How is a periodic tuning spec repeated? I assume this is rather simple: for first period (preiod commonly octave) take the orig scale pitches, for the second period add the period (e.g., 1200 cent) to these pitches, for the third period add 2 * the period etc.
 

     Example: pajara TOP tuning 
     [[file:/Applications/Scala/scl/erlich_paj3.scl::Applications%20Scala%20scl%20erlich_paj3%20scl][file:/Applications/Scala/scl/erlich_paj3.scl::Applications Scala scl erlich_paj3 scl]]


     When loading a scala file, a warning a shown if the present number of notes per octave and the number of scale notes does conflict

     Pitch_i = (G*N) - (P*M) 

     Total number of pitches N*M

     scale = []
     for nSteps in range(stepsPerPeriod):
     root = (nSteps*generator)%period
     for repeat in range(periodsPerOctave):
     scale.append(period*repeat + root)
     scale.sort()
     
     It assumes the generator and period are specified in cents. 
     It also assumes periodsPerOctave is given. If you don't 
     have that you can still get a tuning table for one period.
     
     sorted([(n*generator)%period
     for n in range(stepsPerPeriod)])

*** Info

**** Overview

     My harmony model supports equi-distant divisions of the octave. By keeping this as is, I can introduce the idea of alternate tunings for the playback. Nevertheless, pitches (and pitch classes etc) are still represented by FD ints, but these ints are used as indices into a tuning table for playback. 

     Application examples: play music with 12 pitches per octave in meantone, play music with 22 pitches per octave using some pajara temperament (e.g., TOP tuning). 

     Note: the definition of the music theory must possibly be modified (e.g., only particular keys are useful in meantone). 


**** Tuning table definition

     I have to decide for either format

***** Format 1: similar to Scala scale format

      Tuning table is a tuple with floats which map note pitches (integers) to pitches measured in cent (MIDI floats). 

      For simplicity, only a single period is defined (typically one octave). Additional tuning table features are the 'size' (int: number of pitches) and the 'period' (a float, MIDI cent) -- which is also the last pitch in the tuning table

      The mapping for arbitrary pitches are accessed by the following formula

      Octave = Pitch div TuningTable.size
      PC = Pitch mod TuningTable.size 
      TuningTable.PC + Octave * TuningTable.period


***** Format 2: Full tuning table

      Tuning table: Tuning specification format: a tuple with floats which map note pitches (integers) to pitches measured in cent (MIDI floats). There is an entry for all possible pitches. 

      Such a tuning table is either created by hand, or by some program. Examples: 
      - Transformation of a tuning spec for an octave to a full tuning table by octave transpositions
      - Program for regular temperaments, expecting generator and period intervals
      - Program parsing and processing Scala files (see below)


**** Tuning table use

***** Possibly: Use directly, e.g., in a custom-made Csound output proc

***** More effective: modify getPitchInMidi to use tuning table

****** Defining static tuning table

       A static tuning table is settable/accessible by pair of (internally stateful) procs like {Init.setTuningTable Table} and {Init.getTuningTable ?Table}. Defaults to nil, in which case getPitchInMidi calculates pitch as before. Otherwise, user-defined tuning-table is used.


****** ?? Changing tuning table on-the-fly

       getPitchInMidi expects optional arg tuning table, so tuning can be changed on-the-fly

       Note: for changing tunings on-the-fly I should somehow put tuning tables in score and these tuning tables should be used by output 


**** Scale scale support						 :MAYBE:

     Idea: method getPitchInMidi gets couterpart getPitchInMidi_Tempered where the pitch spec depends on a *.scl file, whose path is either given to some proc in Init, or (for changing the tuning on the fly) to the method getPitchInMidi_Tempered directly.  

     getPitchInMidi_Tempered uses some record which contains the pitches for all pitches (some upper limit?). I may also always compute pitches on the fly -- if the computation does not depend on computing other pitches first...
     This record is created by evaluating the scala file (first parsing it, then ...).
     
     If HS pitches per octave and spec in Scala file disagree, then ... 

***** Program more simple temperament support (at first) 

      - Tuning values are entered by hand (no parsing of Scala file)
      - Tuning values are all cents
      - However, octave may be \= 1200 cent, and temperament shifts tuning by corresponding (reduced/streched) octave for computing any pitch



** Reconsider automatic releases					 :MAYBE:

   I would like to speed up my release process (so I would release Strasheela more often)

   The only tools for automating this I found so far are freshmeat-submit and shipper

   Plus: I may release info on more sites than now (ibiblio)
   Downside: somewhat targeted towards Linux apps and RPM packages, no support for sourceforge upload
   
   Note: Installation seems to work out of the box on a Mac.

** Read Strasheela doc							  :EASY:

   know your system, e.g., know all my Patterns 

** Develop new expressive patterns					 :MAYBE:

   UseMotifs pattern generalises cycle pattern by introducing multiple alternatives. Can I generalise or variate other pattern constraints similarily. Goal is to create "interestingly" shaped sequences of FD ints and FD int combinations (e.g. pairs) 

*** Higher order functions like Map selecting from multiple function alternatives

    Rough idea: generalise functions like Map/ForAll or MapNeighbours/ForNeighbours to expect a list of functions/procedures from which it selects freely one for each function/procedure application. 


*** Soft cycle patterns 
    
**** TODO define cycle pattern where the cycle period is FD int and constrainable

**** TODO Define reified cycle pattern CycleRs 

     {CycleRs Xs Bs Period}

     Xs is list of FD ints which is constrained to follow cycle, Period is period length of the cycle (an FD int), and Bs is list of 0/1 ints of same length as Xs. For each Xs element which does indeed follow the cycle its corresponding Bs element is 1 and 0 otherwise
     Application example: constrain Bs with Pattern.percentTrue_Range so that, e.g., 60-90% of the Bs follow the cycle pattern and the rest does not

**** Cycle variant where non-cycle elements are possibly inserted

     {DiscontinuousCycleRs Xs Ys Bs}

     Xs is list of FD ints. Ys is list of FD ints which is quasi a sublist of Xs, but neighbours in Ys are not necessarily neighbours in Ys. Bs is a list of 0/1 ints of length Xs, specifying whether the corresponding Xs element is an element of Ys and thus part of the cycle or not. If the Xs elements for which Bs element is 0 are ignored, then the remaining Xs elements form a strict cycle pattern (i.e. occur in the order they are in Y, plus wrapping at the end of Ys).




*** Soft contour constraint

    Idea: most intervals follow given contour, but not all. Combines
    Contour and Pattern.percentTrue_Range (percentage specified as range)

    Applications: 

    - Contour of melody follows simple shape in general (e.g. first ascending then
      decending), but there are exceptions

      -> I got this idea while listening to some non-Western music..

      Option: additionally, the overall direction of the melody is
      constrained by constraining specific intervals (e.g. between
      first and last pitch)

**** TODO Define constraint InpreciseContour (name?)
**** Define example (see above)


*** TODO Length-independend pattern constraints like contour

    Some constraint which expects two lists of FD ints (i.e. length of lists is determined) and constraints that all elements of the shorter list (first arg?) are contained *in their order* in the longer list (second arg?), but that the longer list might contain intermediate elements (i.e. neighbouring elements of the shorter list are not necessarily neighbours in the longer list, their might be one or more elements in between).
    The constraint allows for multiple solutions for the longer list (e.g. where the additional elements are inserted), but should not necessarily insert any additional choice point. Can I define such a constraint with or? 
    Optional additional arg constraint (proc) expects list {$ [OrigVar1 NewVar1 .. OrigVar2]} where OrigVar are also elements in the shorter list and allows to apply additional constraints to the inserted elements.  
    
    This constraint can be used, e.g., to constrain two pitch sequences to the same contour, even if they are of different length. The optional constraint arg allows to specify, e.g., that inserted elements "follow the same contour".
    E.g., if the orig contour is the following (example determined and uses symbols for simplicity)

    [+ + - = - +] 
    
    The one might constrain that inserted elements are the same as their predecessing org element. So, the following may be a longer list, a contour with inserted elements 

    [+ + + - - = - - +]




*** Constraint on list of 0/1 variables how evenly these are distributed

    e.g., I may want to specify that no two 1 (or two 0) follow each other, or that the sum of N neighbouring elements tends to be the same throughout the list

   -> I could interactively ask whether these extensions shall be installed / deinstalled 


   Problem: making it interactive could cause problems for package providers -- for them I should then introduce script arguments which allow to set this decision before the script runs

    Actually I think (from experience with Java unit tests in
    industry) that there should be something better than wait in real
    time for a timeout when testing concurrent programs.  The timeouts
    slow down the tests a lot, and the outcome is nondeterministic
    (e.g. tests run fine for the developer, but fail in a complete
    system build).
    
    I'd like a meta-interpreter which can provoke all the nasty races
    deterministically and test that they are handled correctly, and
    run as quickly as possibly by simulating the passage of time.  But
    that would be a very big project.
